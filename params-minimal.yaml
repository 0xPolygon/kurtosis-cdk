# Minimal CDK Configuration
# This configuration minimizes L1 transactions by:
# 1. Disabling OP Batcher (saves ~950 txs)
# 2. Disabling OP Proposer (saves ~20 txs)
# 3. Disabling Bridge Spammer (saves ~180 txs)
# 4. Disabling other test services
#
# Expected L1 transactions: ~76 (contract deployments + admin setup only)

args:
  # Disable all additional test services
  additional_services: []

  # Pessimistic mode configuration (L2-only, no L1 submission)
