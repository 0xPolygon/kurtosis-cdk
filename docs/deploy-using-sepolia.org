* Deploy to Sepolia

In some scenarios, it's desirable to run the Kurtosis CDK package with
a real testnet rather than using a local chain. This document will
show how to modify the configuration of the Kurtosis CDK package in
order to deploy to [[https://sepolia.etherscan.io/][Sepolia]].

** Disable Local L1

The first thing we should do is make sure that Kurtosis doesn't bother
doing the L1 deployment. We're going to use [[https://github.com/kislyuk/yq][yq]] to do carry this out.

#+begin_src bash
yq -Y --in-place '.deploy_l1 = false' params.yml
#+end_src

This will stop Kurtosis from using spinning up the L1 [[https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/ethereum-package][Ethereum package]]. Since we're using Sepolia, there will be no need.

** Changing Deployment Salt

If this isn't the first time deploying the CDK contracts to Sepolia with a specific address, the [[https://github.com/0xPolygon/kurtosis-cdk/blob/main/templates/contract-deploy/deploy_parameters.json#L12][salt]] must be changed.

** Increase Timeout for CDK Node

The timeout for deploying the [[https://github.com/0xPolygon/kurtosis-cdk/blob/main/lib/cdk_node.star#L21][CDK Node]] must be increased since we are deploying to Sepolia which will take longer to verify batches than a local L1. 

#+begin_src bash
-                args["zkevm_aggregator_port"], application_protocol="grpc"
+                args["zkevm_aggregator_port"], application_protocol="grpc", wait = "60m"
#+end_src

** Application Key Rotation

By default, the CDK package has some hard coded keys. This is fine for
local testing, but if you run on sepolia, you're likely to get your
funds stolen even if it's inadvertent. First, let's create a new
mnemonic seed phrase to derive our application keys.

#+begin_src bash :exports both verbatim :results output example
cast wallet new-mnemonic
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
Successfully generated a new mnemonic.
Phrase:
multiply smoke dash galaxy priority speak sell decade diamond crew charge because

Accounts:
- Account 0:

#+end_example

Great! Now we have a new seed phrase to use. Now, we'll take that seed
phrase and write generate the settings for ~params.yml~.


#+begin_src bash :exports both verbatim :results output example
seed="multiply smoke dash galaxy priority speak sell decade diamond crew charge because"
polycli wallet inspect --mnemonic "$seed" --addresses 9 | \
    jq -r '.Addresses[] | [.ETHAddress, .HexPrivateKey] | @tsv' | \
    awk 'BEGIN{split("sequencer,aggregator,claimtxmanager,timelock,admin,loadtest,agglayer,dac,proofsigner",roles,",")} {print "zkevm_l2_" roles[NR] "_address: \"" $1 "\""; print "zkevm_l2_" roles[NR] "_private_key: \"0x" $2 "\"\n"}'

#+end_example

We're going to take these generated values and place them into the
[[../params.yml]] file. Each one of these settings should already exist
and you're simply replacing the keys that are already in this file.

** L1 Configuration

Now we need to adjust the parameters for L1 specifically for
Sepolia. First, let's create a new mnemonic specifically for running
contract deployment.

#+begin_src bash :exports both verbatim :results output example
cast wallet new-mnemonic
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
Phrase:
proof slam law choose steak beach fee cousin rate soup bunker undo

Accounts:
- Account 0:
Address:     0x2eEfbBbbb4344CAa1180593EBCDFC20a60f54bae
Private key: 0xff4eacda829d92184a5f385097daf968fd0730e48a7ed4ab321f79e5154d5096
#+end_example


We'll take that mnemonic and configure ~l1_preallocated_mnemonic~ with
this value.

#+begin_src bash
yq -Y --in-place '.args.l1_preallocated_mnemonic = "proof slam law choose steak beach fee cousin rate soup bunker undo"' params.yml
#+end_src

This account is used for two things. It sends funds to the accounts
that need funds on L1 (e.g. sequencer, aggregator, admin).  This
account also does the contract deployment. Accordingly, we'll need to
send funds to this account.

There are a few other values we need to configure for L1.

#+begin_src bash
yq -Y --in-place '.args.l1_chain_id = 11155111' params.yml
yq -Y --in-place '.args.l1_funding_amount = "5ether"' params.yml
yq -Y --in-place '.args.l1_rpc_url = "https://YOUR-SEPOLIA-RPC.invalid"' params.yml
yq -Y --in-place '.args.l1_ws_url = "wss://YOUR-SEPOLIA-RPC.invalid"' params.yml
#+end_src

** Running the Network

All of the configuration should be set. Let's run things:

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
#+end_src

While the deployment process is ongoing, you may notice that the Kurtosis deployment is stuck at
#+begin_src bash
Starting the cdk node components
#+end_src

This is because now that the L1 is Sepolia, it takes longer to verify the batches. In the process, when looking at the CDK Node's container you should see it exited.
#+begin_src bash
docker ps -a | grep ghcr.io/0xpolygon/cdk
#+end_src

We need to monitor the logs of the Erigon Sequencer to make sure the first batch has been verified on L1 before restarting the exited CDK Node container.
#+begin_src bash
kurtosis service logs cdk-v1 cdk-erigon-sequencer-001 -f
#+end_src

While waiting for the batches to verify on Sepolia, you should see the below logs.
#+begin_src bash
[cdk-erigon-sequencer-001] [INFO] [08-29|02:22:20.487] [5/13 Execution] Starting sequencing stage 
[cdk-erigon-sequencer-001] [WARN] [08-29|02:22:20.487] [5/13 Execution] ForkId is 0. Waiting for L1 to finalise a block... 
#+end_src

You should expect to see the below logs once the batches have been verified on Sepolia.
#+begin_src bash
[cdk-erigon-sequencer-001] [INFO] [08-29|02:11:56.349] [5/13 Execution] Starting sequencing stage

[cdk-erigon-sequencer-001] [INFO] [08-29|02:12:02.380] [5/13 Execution] Waiting for txs from the pool... 
#+end_src

Now the CDK Node container can be restarted
#+begin_src bash
docker start <CDK_Node_Container_ID>
#+end_src

You should see the Kurtosis deployment continuing and finishing shortly after.

To make sure that the network is functional, you can query the below commands, and after approximately 20 minutes, you should see the virtualBatchNumber and verifiedBatchNumber incrementing.
#+begin_src bash
cast rpc zkevm_batchNumber 
cast rpc zkevm_virtualBatchNumber 
cast rpc zkevm_verifiedBatchNumber 
#+end_src

Once this completes, you'll probably want to see your deployed
contracts an on-chain activity.

#+begin_src bash :exports both verbatim :results output code
kurtosis service exec cdk-v1 contracts-001 'cat /opt/zkevm/combined.json'
#+end_src

#+end_src

These are all of the generated details from the network. We can see
some of the contracts in Etherscan / Blockscout now:

- Sequenced batches should show up here https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x9Ed8D0046723111F7212331D07Ba02c344a9d955
- Verified batches should show up here https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xcaf5779919bD483d03ef4b7a9590a963b987F0B6

* Separate Contract Deployment

If we followed the steps above, we would have local test environment
that using Sepolia as the L1 chain, but the environment itself would
not be persistent and there wouldn't be a straight forward way to use
a separate contract deployment.

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis service exec cdk-v1 contracts-001 'cat /opt/zkevm/combined.json' | tail -n +2 | jq '.' > templates/contract-deploy/combined.json
kurtosis service exec cdk-v1 contracts-001 'cat /opt/zkevm/genesis.json' | tail -n +2 | jq '.' > templates/contract-deploy/genesis.json
#+end_src


* Troubleshooting

One piece of general advice: if your ~kurtosis run~ fails for some
reason in the middle of the run, you'll usually want to do a full
cleanup of the enclave before trying to run again.

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis clean --all
#+end_src


** Replay-Protected Transactions

After ~kurtosis run~ you might see an error like this:

#+begin_example
ProviderError: only replay-protected (EIP-155) transactions allowed over RPC
#+end_example

The deployment of the [[https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts][zkevm-contracts]] uses a specific method to
maintain [[https://yamenmerhi.medium.com/nicks-method-ethereum-keyless-execution-168a6659479c#0c39][consistent addresses]] across chains. If you're seeing this
error, it means your RPC provider is blocking these transactions. If
you're running your own node you'll need to make some configuration
changes. E.g. in [[https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options][geth]] you would set ~rpc.allow-unprotected-txs~:

#+begin_example
    --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs         (default: false)                   ($GETH_RPC_ALLOW_UNPROTECTED_TXS)
          Allow for unprotected (non EIP155 signed) transactions to be submitted via RPC
#+end_example

If you're not running your own node, you'll need to use an RPC
provider that allows unprotected transactions. In the example for this
guide, I've used [[https://www.alchemy.com/][Alchmey]].

** Cannot find module './deploy_output.json'

If you've been running into issues or potentially run ~kurtosis run~
multiple times, it's possible that you run into an issue like this:

}
#+end_example

This can happen if the same address is used to deploy the contracts
multiple times with the same salt. In order to do a clean up there are
a few things you should do.

First, you should make sure you've cleaned up your local environment
properly:

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis clean --all
#+end_src

Once you've cleaned up your environment, you should either rotate your
~l1_preallocated_mnemonic~ to a new address in order to avoid the
conflict or you can update the ~salt~ value in the
[[../templates/contract-deploy/deploy_parameters.json][deploy_parameters.json]] file. Each run of the contract deployment needs
to be a new combination of ~l1_preallocated_mnemonic~ and
~salt~. Swapping the salt is probably the easiest way to do another
deployment.

We don't encounter this issue in local testing because we reset the
entire L1 chain between tests / contract deployments.
