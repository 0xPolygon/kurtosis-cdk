# Overview

Kurtosis is a developer platform that allows you to package and launch a backend stack without becoming overburdened with configuration details.

The Polygon developer team have implemented a Kurtosis build for the CDK stack which includes all zkEVM node components, all services, and a validium option also.

## CDK architecture

The diagram below shows how CDK stack components may interact with each other and with a layer 1 blockchain.

## Get started

The [quick start documents](quickstart/deploy-stack.md) show you how to deploy a private, portable, and modular Polygon CDK developer stack on [Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis).

The deployment document is aimed at users and developers who do not necessarily want to run the latest CDK versions, or follow the full tutorials, and are happy to play around with an experimental set up.
