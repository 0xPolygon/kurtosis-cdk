# Overview

[Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/) is a developer platform that allows you to package and launch a backend stack without becoming overburdened with configuration details.

The Polygon team has implemented a stable CDK build with Kurtosis which includes all node components and services, as well as a validium option.

The documentation in this get started section relates to the CDK Kurtosis implementation.

## CDK architecture

The diagram below shows how CDK stack components may interact with each other and with a layer 1 blockchain.
