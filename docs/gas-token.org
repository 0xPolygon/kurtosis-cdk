* Gas Token Setup

Let's walk through how you can use this package to test a CDK that
uses a gas token. There is a lot of detailed information about this
architecture in the [[https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-techdocs/blob/a6d46da98ad32ace544e5dbc31d34831f9cc1bdd/knowledge-layer/architecture/PDFs/ulxly.pdf][knowledge layer docs]]. The following section from
the docs is a helpful explanation of the Gas Token:

#+begin_quote
If we use a token to pay the gas at a layer, we call this token, the
gas token for the layer. If we are using a gas token at a layer, it is
still possible to send L1 ETH to the layer. In this case, the ETH gets
accounted in an ERC20 contract called W-ETH, which is just another
ERC20 instance.
#+end_quote

#+CAPTION: Diagram illustrating the interchange of assets between layers, focusing on LY as a layer of interest. It depicts several scenarios, such as bridging a ERC20 token from mainnet to another ERC20 token in LY, bridging L1 ETH to the LY gas token or bridging a wrapped ERC20 token living on LX to LY ETH.

In order to try the gas token out in your local environment, first
edit the [[../params.yml][params.yml]] file to set ~zkevm_use_gas_token_contract~ as
~true~. When you make this change a few things will happen during
setup:

1. During contract deployment, an ERC20 token will be deployed on L1
2. The [[../templates/create_rollup_parameters.json][rollup creation parameters]] will be modified to set the
   ~gasTokenAddress~ to the address of the L1 ERC20

After setting the ~zkevm_use_gas_token_contract~, you should be all
set to run Kurtosis.

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
#+end_src

This will take a few minutes as the full set of contracts will be
compiled and deployed. When this is finished you should see the full
set of services that were deployed.

[[file:gas-token-img/services.png]]

For the rest of this guide I'll probably only be interested in three
of these mapped services: the bridge UI, the L1 RPC, and the L2 RPC.

To get started let's extract the generated files and take a look at
the ~gasTokenAddress~ (note: you'll need to have [[https://jqlang.github.io/jq/][jq]] installed):

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis files download cdk-v1 zkevm /tmp
cat /tmp/zkevm/create_rollup_parameters.json | jq '.gasTokenAddress'
#+end_src

Running this command will give us the address of our ERC20 token. In
order to bridge, we should mint some of this token. IN order to run
this command, you'll also need to have the [[https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation][Foundry toolchain]]
installed.

#+begin_src bash
cast send \
--mnemonic "code code code code code code code code code code code quality" \
--rpc-url "$(kurtosis port print cdk-v1 el-1-geth-lighthouse rpc)" \
"$(jq -r '.gasTokenAddress' /tmp/zkevm/create_rollup_parameters.json)" \
'mint(address,uint256)' \
0x85dA99c8a7C2C95964c8EfD687E95E632Fc533D6 1000000000000000000000000000
#+end_src

Assuming that worked we can check our token balance as well:
#+begin_src bash
cast call \
--rpc-url "$(kurtosis port print cdk-v1 el-1-geth-lighthouse rpc)" \
"$(jq -r '.gasTokenAddress' /tmp/zkevm/create_rollup_parameters.json)" \
'balanceOf(address)(uint256)' \
0x85dA99c8a7C2C95964c8EfD687E95E632Fc533D6
#+end_src

Now that we have some L1 Gas Token, let's open up the bridge
UI. You'll need to open your browser to the address of of the bridge
ui service. Run this command to get the URL easily and then open the
URL in your browser.

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis port print cdk-v1 zkevm-bridge-ui-001 bridge-ui
#+end_src

You'll need to need to add RPCs for L1 and L2 to your browser
wallet. Because the URLs are using HTTP instead of HTTPS, you'll need
to [[https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC][add the RPCs]] manually to Metamask. The URL for the L1 and L2 RPCs
can be retrieved with these commands:

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis port print cdk-v1 el-1-geth-lighthouse rpc
kurtosis port print cdk-v1 zkevm-node-rpc-001 http-rpc
#+end_src

Additionally, if you used the mnemonic ~code...quality~, you'll also
want to [[https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-How-to-import-an-account#h_01G01W07NV7Q94M7P1EBD5BYM4][import an account]] using a private key. The first derived
private key from the ~code...quality~ mnemonic is
~42b6e34dc21598a807dc19d7784c71b2a7a01f6480dc6f58258f78e539f1a1fa~.

Now we'll need to add the gas token to the bridge interface and
attempt to bridge. First, you'll need to click the token dropdown
menu:

[[file:gas-token-img/01_bridge.png]]

In the modal, you'll want to paste the ERC 20 Gas Token address that
we found earlier with this command:
#+begin_src bash
cat /tmp/zkevm/create_rollup_parameters.json | jq '.gasTokenAddress'
#+end_src

[[file:gas-token-img/02_bridge.png]]

Confirm the details of your token and then click the add button.

[[file:gas-token-img/03_bridge.png]]

Now that the token has been added, you'll need to select the token for
bridging.

[[file:gas-token-img/04_bridge.png]]

At this point you should be all set to actually make the bridge

[[file:gas-token-img/05_bridge.png]]

Now your bridge deposit should be pending.
[[file:gas-token-img/06_bridge.png]]

After some time, your transaction should show as claimed. If it
doesn't, it's possible the autoclaiming service on L2 is not
funded. You should be able to send it some ether on L2 by running a
command like this:

#+begin_src bash
cast send --legacy \
--value 10ether \
--private-key 0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625 \
--rpc-url "$(kurtosis port print cdk-v1 zkevm-node-rpc-001 http-rpc)" \
0x5f5dB0D4D58310F53713eF4Df80ba6717868A9f8
#+end_src

[[file:gas-token-img/07_bridge.png]]

At this point if you switch Metamask to your L2 network, you should
see the bridge value as native value on L2.
