# Resequencing batches with the Erigon sequencer

In the case of the sequencer receiving "bad" batches, which are effectively unprovable, it is possible to resequence.
The attached [script](./test_resequence.sh) provides an automation to test this kind of scenario. Please refer to the script for quick testing.

In cases where you'd want to manually trigger such cases, refer to the below steps:

The high level steps to resequence in the provided script is:

1. Stop sequencer
2. Change configs to simulate bad batches
3. Start sequencer with modified config
4. Inject load
5. Wait for batches to virtualize
6. Stop cdk-node-001
7. Stop sequencer
8. Rollback batches on L1 contract
9. Unwind to batch in sequencer with `integration` command
10. Change sequencer config to resequence
11. Start sequencer
12. Once resequencing is done/timed out, stop the sequencer
13. Change to normal config and restart sequencer
14. Start cdk-node-001
15. Compare block hashes from sequencer and erigon rpc

Assuming that you encountered bad batches, or want to resequence for some reason, we can reference the steps above:

#### Make backup of the configs

```bash
kurtosis service exec cdk  cdk-erigon-sequencer-001 "cp \-r /etc/cdk-erigon/ /tmp/"
```

#### Stop the cdk-node
It is important to stop the cdk-node-001 service when attempting this procedure.

```bash
kurtosis service stop cdk cdk-node-001
```

#### Stop the sequencer
The Erigon sequencer image in Kurtosis CDK is setup so that the `cdk-erigon` process can be killed without exitting the container. This allows changing the configuration of the sequencer more easily.

```bash
# Send a SIGTRAP signal to the proc-runner process
kurtosis service exec cdk cdk-erigon-sequencer-001 "pkill -SIGTRAP "proc-runner.sh"" || true
# Send a SIGINT signal to the cdk-erigon process
kurtosis service exec cdk cdk-erigon-sequencer-001 "pkill -SIGINT "cdk-erigon"" || true
```

#### Geting the latest L1 verified batch
This can usually be done by querying the L1 explorer, but in a Kurtosis devnet environment, this can be done by querying the rollup manager contract.

```bash
# Queries the latest verified batch number
current_batch=$(cast logs --rpc-url "$(kurtosis port print cdk el-1-geth-lighthouse rpc)" --address 0x1Fe038B54aeBf558638CA51C91bC8cCa06609e91 --from-block 0 --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.topics[0] == "0x9c72852172521097ba7e1482e6b44b351323df0155f97f4ea18fcec28e1f5966" or .topics[0] == "0xd1ec3a1216f08b6eff72e169ceb548b782db18a6614852618d86bb19f3f9b0d3") | .topics[1]' | tail -n 1 | sed 's/^0x//')

# Converts hexadecimal value
current_batch_dec=$((16#$current_batch))
```

- `0x1Fe038B54aeBf558638CA51C91bC8cCa06609e91` is the address of our particular rollup contract.

#### Rollback batches on L1 contract
Since the CDK network is managed by the L1 rollup manager contract, its important to trigger a batch rollback on the L1 rollup manager contract for our particular network after the L2 network is stopped.

```bash
cast send "0x2F50ef6b8e8Ee4E579B17619A92dE3E2ffbD8AD2" "rollbackBatches(address,uint64)" "0x1Fe038B54aeBf558638CA51C91bC8cCa06609e91" "$latest_verified_batch" --private-key "0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625" --rpc-url "$(kurtosis port print cdk el-1-geth-lighthouse rpc)"
```

- `0x2F50ef6b8e8Ee4E579B17619A92dE3E2ffbD8AD2` is the address of the rollup manager contract on L1
- `0x1Fe038B54aeBf558638CA51C91bC8cCa06609e91` is the address of our particular rollup contract.
- `0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625` is the private key of the admin address.

#### Unwind batches in the sequencer using `integration` command

The erigon sequencer image used in Kurtosis CDK comes with a built-in `integration` command line tool.

```

Using the `integration` command, we can unwind batches to the latest verified batch.

```bash
kurtosis service exec cdk cdk-erigon-sequencer-001 "integration state_stages_zkevm --config=/etc/cdk-erigon/config.yaml --unwind-batch-no=$latest_verified_batch --chain dynamic-kurtosis --datadir /home/erigon/data/dynamic-kurtosis-sequencer"
```

#### Change sequencer config to resequence with timeout enabled

```bash
kurtosis service exec cdk cdk-erigon-sequencer-001 "timeout 300s cdk-erigon --pprof=true --pprof.addr 0.0.0.0 --config /etc/cdk-erigon/config.yaml --datadir /home/erigon/data/dynamic-kurtosis-sequencer  --zkevm.sequencer-resequence-strict=false --zkevm.sequencer-resequence=true --zkevm.sequencer-resequence-reuse-l1-info-index=true"
```

After the above is done, stop the sequencer again.

```bash
# Send a SIGTRAP signal to the proc-runner process
kurtosis service exec cdk cdk-erigon-sequencer-001 "pkill -SIGTRAP "proc-runner.sh"" || true
# Send a SIGINT signal to the cdk-erigon process
kurtosis service exec cdk cdk-erigon-sequencer-001 "pkill -SIGINT "cdk-erigon"" || true
```

#### Restart the cdk-node

```bash
kurtosis service start cdk cdk-node-001
```

#### Monitor logs and check blocks

The resequencing should be complete. Monitor the logs for the CDK components:
- Check the latest block number and arbitrary block hashes from the sequencer
- Check the latest block number and arbitrary block hashes from the erigon rpc and compare
- Check that the L1 verified batch number increments after some time
