The [quick start documents](quickstart/deploy-stack.md) show you how to deploy a private, portable, and modular Polygon CDK developer stack with [Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis).

The deployment document is aimed at users and developers who do not necessarily want to run the latest CDK versions, or follow the full tutorials, and are happy to play around with an experimental set up.
