# How to edit zkEVM contracts for Kurtosis CDK

A step-by-step guide to edit the zkEVM Solidity contracts in a Polygon CDK devnet.

This document draws from the following resources:

- [Polygon CDK Kurtosis Package](../README.md)
- [Custom Docker Images for Kurtosis CDK](../docker/README.md)
- [Video guide to the Polygon CDK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ykNLEhwxIs)

## Goals

- Edit the Solidity code in repo `zkevm-contracts` in file `VerifierRollupHelperMock.sol` in function `verifyProof`.
- Rebuild the `zkevm-contracts` docker image.
- Edit this repo `kurtosis-cdk` to use our new build of `zkevm-contracts`.
- Spin up a Polygon CDK devnet and observe our changes in the active devnet.

# Set up your system

Set up your system as per instructions at [Polygon CDK Kurtosis Package](../README.md):

- Install Docker and Kurtosis.
- Run `./scripts/tool_check.sh`.

If you get an error about an incorrect version of Kurtosis then install the correct version as described in [Kurtosis documentation](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install-historical/).

Spin up a Polygon CDK devnet on your local machine. The process should complete within 10 minutes.

```bash
kurtosis clean --all
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
```

Feel free to follow [subsequent instructions](../README.md) to play with your devnet.

Let's take a look at the Solidity code we want to change. Attach a shell to `contracts-001` container:

```bash
kurtosis service shell cdk-v1 contracts-001
```

In the attached shell take a peek at the Solidity code for `verifyProof`:

```bash
cat zkevm-contracts/contracts/mocks/VerifierRollupHelperMock.sol
```

You should see

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0

pragma solidity 0.8.20;

import "../interfaces/IVerifierRollup.sol";

contract VerifierRollupHelperMock is IVerifierRollup {
    function verifyProof(
        bytes32[24] calldata proof,
        uint256[1] memory pubSignals
    ) public pure override returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }
}
```

Exit the attached shell when you're done examining the `contracts-001` container:

```bash
exit
```

Let's observe that proofs are passing verification as expected. Use your preferred method to view the logs for the container `zkevm-agglayer-001`. For example, you could use the Docker Desktop graphical interface, or you could follow in a terminal via

```bash
kurtosis service logs cdk-v1 zkevm-agglayer-001 --follow
```

You should see logs like

```

```

Tear down your devnet after you're done playing:

```bash
kurtosis clean --all
```

# Fetch and edit the docker image `zkevm-contracts`

Clone the repo [`zkevm-contracts`](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts). Due to Docker's constraints on coyping files from the local build context, it will help us later to clone this repo into a new subdirectory `docker/local-test-zkevm-contracts` of the current repo `kurtosis-cdk`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts.git docker/local-test-zkevm-contracts
```

Optional: add `docker/local-test-zkevm-contracts` to your `.gitignore` file in repo `kurtosis-cdk` to suppress git messages about the repo you just cloned.

We don't want any nasty surprises, so let's checkout the version of this repo that's currently used in `kurtosis-cdk`:

```bash
cd docker/local-test-zkevm-contracts
git checkout v6.0.0-rc.1-fork.9
```

Open the file `docker/local-test-zkevm-contracts/contracts/mocks/VerifierRollupHelperMock.sol` and make a silly change:

```diff
diff --git a/contracts/mocks/VerifierRollupHelperMock.sol b/contracts/mocks/VerifierRollupHelperMock.sol
index 85e6b91..20e51c4 100644

-        return true;
+        return false;
     }
 }
```

This change causes the function `verifyProof` to reject any proof it's given.

# Rebuild the docker image `zkevm-contracts`

Let's modify the repo `kurtosis-cdk` to build the docker image `zkevm-contracts` from your local file system, and then use that new image in the devnet.

You can make the following edits manually, or fetch them from the `edit-contracts-demo` branch of [Espresso's fork of `kurtosis-cdk`](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/kurtosis-cdk/tree/edit-contracts-demo).

Open the file `docker/zkevm-contracts.Dockerfile` and make the following edits:

```diff
diff --git a/docker/zkevm-contracts.Dockerfile b/docker/zkevm-contracts.Dockerfile
index 1a18e9c..531f667 100644

```

This change tells Docker to build the image `zkevm-contracts` from your new local version of that repo instead of fetching it from github.

Next let's rebuild our edited docker image `zkevm-contracts`. Open a terminal in your repo `kurtosis-cdk`, move to the `docker` directory, and rebuild the image:

```bash
cd docker
docker build . \
 --tag local/zkevm-contracts:fork9 \
 --build-arg ZKEVM_CONTRACTS_BRANCH=v6.0.0-rc.1-fork.9 \
 --build-arg POLYCLI_VERSION=main \
 --file zkevm-contracts.Dockerfile
```

Your new image should now be visible in docker. The command

```bash
docker images --filter "reference=local/zkevm-contracts"
```

should produce output like

```
REPOSITORY              TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE

```

# Spin up a devnet with your new docker image

Let's spin up a new Polygon CDK devnet with your edited docker image `zkevm-contracts`.

Point your devnet to your local docker image. Open the file `params.yml` and change `leovct/zkevm-contracts` to `local/zkevm-contracts`:

```diff
diff --git a/params.yml b/params.yml
index 5293da7..5e451b6 100644

```

Optional: by default, your devnet disables fancy dashboards. If you want to view your devnet from a fancy dashboard such as Grafana then open the file `params.yml` and ensure that `deploy_observability` is set to `true`.

Spin up your devnet! Just as before, move to the root directory of the repo `kurtosis-cdk` and run

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
```

Let's verify that our edits to the Solidity code are live on this devnet. Just as before, attach a shell to `contracts-001` container and then peek at the Solidity code for `verifyProof`:

```bash
kurtosis service shell cdk-v1 contracts-001
```

Then in the attached shell do

```bash
cat zkevm-contracts/contracts/mocks/VerifierRollupHelperMock.sol
```

You should see your edits in the live code: `return false` instead of `return true`.

Observe that proofs are failing verification as expected in the logs for docker container `zkevm-agglayer-001`. You should see logs like

```

Congratulations! You successfully modified the smart contract verifier and observed your change in a live devnet! ðŸš€
