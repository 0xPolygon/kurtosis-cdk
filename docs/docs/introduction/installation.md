# Installation

To get started with the package, you will need to install a few required tools:

- [kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

If you intend to interact with and debug the devnet, you may also want to consider a few additional tools such as:

- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)  and [yq](https://pypi.org/project/yq/) (v3) - command-line JSON and YAML processors
- [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolchain - Ethereum development toolkit
- [polycli](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-cli) - swiss army knife of blockchain tools developed by engineers at Polygon

You are now ready to launch your first devnet! Head to the [next](./getting-started.md) section to get started.
