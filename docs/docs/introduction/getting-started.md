# Getting Started

Get up and running with the package in just a few steps.

:::info
Make sure you have installed the [required tools](./installation.md)!
:::

## Deploy the Devnet

Let's deploy a local Polygon CDK devnet.

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk github.com/0xPolygon/kurtosis-cdk
```

where `cdk` is the name of the enclave, you can choosse any name you like.

## Inspect the Devnet

First, you will need to figure out which port Kurtosis is using for the L2 RPC. You can get a general feel for the entire network layout by running the following command.

```bash
kurtosis enclave inspect cdk
```

## Retrieve the L2 RPC URL

Let's store the L2 RPC URL in an environment variable for use with `cast`.

```bash
export ETH_RPC_URL=$(kurtosis port print cdk op-el-1-op-geth-op-node-001 rpc)
echo $ETH_RPC_URL
```

:::tip
If you want to get the L1 RPC URL, you can use a similar command:

```bash
kurtosis port print cdk el-1-geth-lighthouse rpc
```

:::

## Query the network

Get the latest block number using cast from the [foundry toolchain](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

```bash
cast block-number
```

## Send transactions

The admin private key, used to deploy Agglayer contracts on L1, is automatically pre-funded with some ether on L1 and L2. You can check its balance using the following command:

```bash
pk="0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625"
cast balance --ether $(cast wallet address --private-key $pk)
```

Let's send some transactions now!

```bash
cast send --private-key $pk --value 0.01ether $(cast address-zero)
```

:::tip
You may want to generate a new wallet and fund it using the admin private key to avoid nonce issues!
:::

Let's send even more transactions using [polycli](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-cli)!

We will use `polycli loadtest` to perform ether transactions and transfer ERC20 tokens between random accounts, as well as execute UniswapV3 swaps. The tool will automatically deploy ERC20 contracts along with the complete [UniswapV3 contract suite](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/overview).

```bash
polycli loadtest --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --private-key $pk --legacy --verbosity 700 --requests 500 --rate-limit 50 --concurrency 5 --mode t
polycli loadtest --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --private-key $pk --legacy --verbosity 700 --requests 500 --rate-limit 10 --mode 2
polycli loadtest --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --private-key $pk --legacy --verbosity 700 --requests 500 --rate-limit 3  --mode uniswapv3
```

## Check the Logs

Pretty often, you will want to check the output from the service. Here is how you can grab some logs:

```bash
kurtosis service logs cdk agglayer --follow
```

## Get Shell Access

In other cases, if you see an error, you might want to get a shell in the service to be able to poke around.

```bash
kurtosis service shell cdk agglayer
```

## Check the Status of the System

One of the most common ways to check the status of the system is to make sure that batches are going through the normal progression of [trusted, virtual, and verified](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/concepts/transaction-finality/).

```bash
cast rpc zkevm_batchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_virtualBatchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_verifiedBatchNumber
```

If the number of verified batches is increasing, then it means the system works properly!

## Bridge Ether

:::info
We rely on [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core), a bash testing framework to run most of our e2e tests. The next steps assume you have it installed.
:::

### Clone the Test Suite

First, clone the [agglayer/e2e](https://github.com/agglayer/e2e) repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agglayer/e2e.git
cd e2e
```

### L1-to-L2 Bridge

Then, run the L1-to-L2 bridge test to bridge some ether from L1 to L2.

```bash
bats --filter 'bridge native ETH from L1 to L2' tests/agglayer/bridges.bats
```

After the tests complete, you should see output similar to:

```bash
The command was successfully executed and returned '0'.
1..1
ok 1 bridge native ETH from L1 to L2
```

### L2-to-L1 Bridge

You can perform the reverse operation by running the L2-to-L1 bridge test.

```bash
bats --filter 'bridge native ETH from L2 to L1' tests/agglayer/bridges.bats
```

After the tests complete, you should see output similar to:

```bash
The command was successfully executed and returned '0'.
1..1
ok 1 bridge native ETH from L2 to L1
```

## Clean Up the Environment

```bash
kurtosis enclave rm --force cdk
```

You're now ready to start exploring and customizing your devnet!
