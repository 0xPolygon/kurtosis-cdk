- Test: bridge L2 -> L1. L2 should send cert, L1 GER updated by agglayer, aggoracle injects new GER 
- Add CLI option to push generated images + edit docker-compose to use pushed images. Sanity check: docker-compose should not use any local image, so any machie can pull the images
- Create GHA to generate snapshots on demand (trigger)
- Remove `snapshot.log` once snapshot is created
- Missing roles for L1 SCs at `summary.json`
- Wrong RPC for L2
- Clean previous docker state capture logic
