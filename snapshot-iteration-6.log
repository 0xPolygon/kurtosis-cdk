=== Build Complete ===

Images:
  Geth: l1-geth:snapshot (74MB)
  Lighthouse: l1-lighthouse:snapshot (400MB)

Manifest: ./snapshot-output/l1-images/manifest.json

Next steps:
  1. Run: cd ./snapshot-output && docker-compose up -d
  2. Wait ~30 seconds for services to start
  3. Verify blocks are increasing:
     docker exec l1-geth geth attach --exec 'eth.blockNumber' /root/.ethereum/geth.ipc
