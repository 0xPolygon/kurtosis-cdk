* Polygon CDK Kurtosis Package

[[file:docs/architecture.png]]

To get started you'll want to get everything [[https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/][installed]]. Once that's
good and installed on your system, you can ~cd~ into this directory
and run:

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
#+end_src

This command will take a few minutes but will basically run an entire
CDK deployment locally. Assuming everything worked, you can do a few
things to quickly play around with your test CDK. The steps below will
assume you have the [[https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation][Foundry toolchain]] installed.

Let's just do a simple RPC call. First you'll need to figure out which
port Kurtosis is using for RPC. You can get a generall feel for the
entire network layout by running:

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis enclave inspect cdk-v1
#+end_src

That output is quite useful might might also be a little
overwhelming. If we want to simply see the port mapping within the
~cdk-v1~ enclave for the ~zkevm-node-rpc~ service and the
~trusted-rpc~ port, we can run this command.

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis port print cdk-v1 zkevm-node-rpc-001 http-rpc
#+end_src

For the sake of this document, I'm going to map that value to an
environment variable.

#+begin_src bash
export ETH_RPC_URL="$(kurtosis port print cdk-v1 zkevm-node-rpc-001 http-rpc)"
#+end_src

That is the same environment variable that ~cast~ uses, so now I
should be able to run this command.

#+begin_src bash
cast block-number
#+end_src

By default, the CDK is configured in test mode which means there is
some pre-funded value in the admin account with address
~0xE34aaF64b29273B7D567FCFc40544c014EEe9970~.

#+begin_src bash
cast balance --ether 0xE34aaF64b29273B7D567FCFc40544c014EEe9970
#+end_src

Okay let's send some transactions...

#+begin_src bash
cast send --legacy --private-key 0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625 --value 0.01ether 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
#+end_src

Okay let's... send even [[https://github.com/maticnetwork/polygon-cli][more transactions]].

#+begin_src bash
polycli loadtest --requests 500 --legacy --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --verbosity 700 --rate-limit 5 --mode t --private-key 0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625
polycli loadtest --requests 500 --legacy --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --verbosity 700 --rate-limit 10 --mode t --private-key 0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625
polycli loadtest --requests 500 --legacy --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --verbosity 700 --rate-limit 10 --mode 2 --private-key 0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625
polycli loadtest --requests 500 --legacy --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --verbosity 700 --rate-limit 3 --mode uniswapv3 --private-key 0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625
cast nonce 0xE34aaF64b29273B7D567FCFc40544c014EEe9970
#+end_src

Pretty often we'll want to check the output from the service. We can
grab some logs:

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis service logs cdk-v1 zkevm-agglayer-001
#+end_src

In other cases, if we see an error we might want to get a shell in the
container to be able to poke around.

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis service shell cdk-v1 zkevm-node-sequencer-001
#+end_src

One of the most common ways to check the status of the system is to
make sure that batches are going through the normal progression of
trusted, virtual, and verified:

#+begin_src bash
cast rpc zkevm_batchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_virtualBatchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_verifiedBatchNumber
#+end_src

When everything is done, you might want to clean up with this command
which stopps everything and deletes it.

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis clean -a
#+end_src

** Permissionless Node

In addition to the core stack, you can also attach and synchronize a
permissionless node. Of course, you'll need the CDK stack running from
the previous commands. Assuming that has run and correctly created a
network, you'll need to pull the genesis file artifact out and add it
to your ~permissionless_node~ kurtosis package.

#+begin_src bash
rm -r /tmp/zkevm
kurtosis files download cdk-v1 genesis /tmp
cp /tmp/genesis.json templates/permissionless-node/genesis.json
#+end_src

Now that we have the right genesis file, we can add a permissionless
node to the ~cdk-v1~ enclave:

#+begin_src bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml --main-file zkevm_permissionless_node.star .
#+end_src

** For Developers

Rather than executing the deployment process as a monolithic operation, you can break it down into stages and run each stage separately.

You can enable a stage by setting the boolean value to /true/ and disable it by setting it to /false/. By default, all stages will be executed.

Currently, the deployment process includes the following stages:

  1. Deploy Local L1
  2. Deploy ZkEVM Contracts on L1
  3. Deploy ZkEVM Node and CDK Peripheral Databases
  4. Deploy CDK Central/Trusted Environment
  5. Deploy CDK/Bridge Infrastructure
  6. Deploy Permissionless Node

Here's an example of how you can specify the stages to run through. In
order to run this you'll need [[https://pypi.org/project/yq/][yq]] installed.

#+begin_src bash
# Disable all deployment steps.
yq -Yi '.deploy_l1 = false' params.yml
yq -Yi '.deploy_zkevm_contracts_on_l1 = false' params.yml
yq -Yi '.deploy_databases = false' params.yml
yq -Yi '.deploy_cdk_central_environment = false' params.yml
yq -Yi '.deploy_cdk_bridge_infra = false' params.yml
yq -Yi '.deploy_zkevm_permissionless_node = false' params.yml

# Deploy L1
yq -Yi '.deploy_l1 = true' params.yml
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
yq -Yi '.deploy_l1 = false' params.yml # reset
# Perform additional tasks...

# Deploy ZkEVM Contracts on L1
yq -Yi '.deploy_zkevm_contracts_on_l1 = true' params.yml
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
yq -Yi '.deploy_zkevm_contracts_on_l1 = false' params.yml # reset
# Perform additional tasks...

# Deploy ZkEVM Node and CDK Peripheral Databases
yq -Yi '.deploy_databases = true' params.yml
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
yq -Yi '.deploy_databases = false' params.yml # reset
# Perform additional tasks...

# Deploy CDK Central Environment
yq -Yi '.deploy_cdk_central_environment = true' params.yml
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
yq -Yi '.deploy_cdk_central_environment = false' params.yml # reset
# Perform additional tasks...

# Deploy CDK Bridge Infrastructure
yq -Yi '.deploy_cdk_bridge_infra = true' params.yml
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
yq -Yi '.deploy_cdk_bridge_infra = false' params.yml # reset
# Perform additional tasks...

# Deploy ZkEVM Permissionless Node
yq -Yi '.deploy_zkevm_permissionless_node = true' params.yml
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
yq -Yi '.deploy_zkevm_permissionless_node = false' params.yml # reset
#+end_src

** Troubleshooting: Mac users

First, ensure that you have [[https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/][Docker Engine]] installed, with a version equal to or higher than 4.27. This is necessary for running the zk Prover on a Mac.

Second, make sure you can access containers using their private IPs. To check that, run the following commands:

#+begin_src bash
docker run --rm --name nginx -d nginx
curl -m 1 -I $(docker inspect nginx --format '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}')
#+end_src

If the last command fails, then it means you need to set up [[https://github.com/chipmk/docker-mac-net-connect?tab=readme-ov-file#installation][docker-mac-net-connect]].

#+begin_quote
Unlike Docker on Linux, Docker-for-Mac does not expose container networks directly on the macOS host.
Docker-for-Mac works by running a Linux VM under the hood (using hyperkit) and creates containers within that VM.
Docker-for-Mac supports connecting to containers over Layer 4 (port binding), but not Layer 3 (by IP address).
#+end_quote

Once installed, you may need to [[https://docs.docker.com/desktop/uninstall/][uninstall]] and [[https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/][reinstall]] Docker Engine.
