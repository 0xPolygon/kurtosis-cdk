# Configuration File for Bridge Server
# This file contains settings for logging, database synchronization, 
# network configuration, transaction management, and metrics collection.
# Each section is defined with specific parameters to customize the behavior of the service.

# Logging Configuration
# This section defines the logging settings, including the log level, 
# environment, and output destination for logs.
