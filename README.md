# Polygon CDK Kurtosis Package

A [Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis) package that deploys a private, portable, and modular [Polygon CDK](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/) devnet over [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Specifically, this package will deploy:

1. A local L1 chain, fully customizable with multi-client support, using the [ethereum-package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package).
2. A local L2 chain, using the [Polygon Chain Development Kit](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/) (CDK), with customizable components such as sequencer, sequence sender, aggregator, rpc, prover, dac, etc. It will first deploy the [Polygon zkEVM smart contracts](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts) on the L1 chain before deploying the different components.
3. The [zkEVM bridge](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-bridge-service) infrastructure to facilitate asset bridging between the L1 and L2 chains, and vice-versa.
4. The [Agglayer](https://github.com/agglayer/agglayer-go), an in-development interoperability protocol, that allows for trustless cross-chain token transfers and message-passing, as well as more complex operations between L2 chains, secured by zk proofs.
5. [Additional services](docs/additional-services.md) such as transaction spammer, monitoring tools, permissionless nodes etc.

> ðŸš¨ This package is currently designed as a **development tool** for testing configurations and scenarios within the Polygon CDK stack. **It is not recommended for long-running or production environments such as testnets or mainnet**. If you need help, you can [reach out to the Polygon team](https://polygon.technology/interest-form) or [talk to an Implementation Partner (IP)](https://ecosystem.polygon.technology/spn/cdk/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To begin, you will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (>= [v4.27.0](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4270) for Mac users) and [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/).

If you intend to interact with and debug the stack, you may also want to consider a few additional optional tools such as:

- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)
- [yq](https://pypi.org/project/yq/) (v3)
- [cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [polycli](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-cli)

### Deploy

Once that is good and installed on your system, you can run the following command to deploy the complete CDK stack locally. The default deployment includes zkevm-contracts ([fork 9](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts/releases/tag/v6.0.0-rc.1-fork.9)), [cdk-erigon](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/cdk-erigon) as the sequencer, and [cdk-node](https://github.com/0xPolygon/cdk) functioning as the sequence sender and aggregator. This process typically takes around eight to ten minutes.

```bash
kurtosis clean --all
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
```

It is also possible to deploy the CDK stack using the legacy zkevm-node sequencer and/or the new zkevm or the legacy zkevm-node sequencer sender and aggregator by modyfing the configuration file `params.yml`.

For example, the CDK stack can be alternatively deployed using zkevm-contracts ([fork 9](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts/releases/tag/v6.0.0-rc.1-fork.9)), with the legacy [zkevm-node](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node) serving as the sequencer, sequence sender and aggregator.

```bash
yq -Y --in-place '.deploy_cdk_erigon_node = false' params.yml
yq -Y --in-place '.args.sequencer_type = "zkevm"' params.yml
kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml .
```

### Interact

Let's do a simple L2 RPC test call.

First, you will need to figure out which port Kurtosis is using for the RPC. You can get a general feel for the entire network layout by running the following command:

```bash
kurtosis enclave inspect cdk-v1
```

That output, while quite useful, might also be a little overwhelming. Let's store the RPC URL in an environment variable. Note that you may need to adjust the various commands slightly if you deployed the legacy [zkevm-node](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node) as the sequencer. You should target the `zkevm-node-rpc-001` service instead of `cdk-erigon-node-001`.

```bash
export ETH_RPC_URL="$(kurtosis port print cdk-v1 cdk-erigon-node-001 http-rpc)"
```

That is the same environment variable that `cast` uses, so you should now be able to run this command. Note that the steps below will assume you have the [Foundry toolchain](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed.

```bash
cast block-number
```

By default, the CDK is configured in `test` mode, which means there is some pre-funded value in the admin account with address `0xE34aaF64b29273B7D567FCFc40544c014EEe9970`.

```bash
cast balance --ether 0xE34aaF64b29273B7D567FCFc40544c014EEe9970
```

Okay, letâ€™s send some transactions...

```bash
export PK="0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625"
cast send --legacy --private-key "$PK" --value 0.01ether 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Okay, letâ€™s send even more transactions... Note that this step will assume you have [polygon-cli](https://github.com/maticnetwork/polygon-cli) installed.

```bash
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$PK" --verbosity 700 --requests 50000 --rate-limit 50 --concurrency 5 --mode t
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$PK" --verbosity 700 --requests 500 --rate-limit 10 --mode 2
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$PK" --verbosity 700 --requests 500 --rate-limit 3  --mode uniswapv3
```

Pretty often, you will want to check the output from the service. Here is how you can grab some logs:

```bash
kurtosis service logs cdk-v1 zkevm-agglayer-001 --follow
```

In other cases, if you see an error, you might want to get a shell in the service to be able to poke around.

```bash
kurtosis service shell cdk-v1 contracts-001
jq . /opt/zkevm/combined.json
```

One of the most common ways to check the status of the system is to make sure that batches are going through the normal progression of [trusted, virtual, and verified](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/concepts/transaction-finality/):

```bash
cast rpc zkevm_batchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_virtualBatchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_verifiedBatchNumber
```

If the number of verified batches is increasing, then it means the system works properly.

To access the `zkevm-bridge` user interface, open this URL in your web browser.

```bash
open "$(kurtosis port print cdk-v1 zkevm-bridge-proxy-001 web-ui)"
```

When everything is done, you might want to clean up with this command which stops the local devnet and deletes it.

```bash
kurtosis clean --all
```
