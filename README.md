# Polygon CDK Kurtosis Package

A [Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis) package that deploys a private, portable, and modular [Polygon CDK](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/) devnet over [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Specifically, this package will deploy:

1. A local L1 chain, fully customizable with multi-client support, using the [ethereum-package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package).
2. A local L2 chain, using the [Polygon Chain Development Kit](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/) (CDK), with customizable components such as sequencer, sequence sender, aggregator, rpc, prover, dac, etc. It will first deploy the [Polygon zkEVM smart contracts](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts) on the L1 chain before deploying the different components.
3. The [zkEVM bridge](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-bridge-service) infrastructure to facilitate asset bridging between the L1 and L2 chains, and vice-versa.
4. The [Agglayer](https://github.com/agglayer/agglayer-go), an in-development interoperability protocol, that allows for trustless cross-chain token transfers and message-passing, as well as more complex operations between L2 chains, secured by zk proofs.
5. [Additional services](docs/additional-services.md) such as transaction spammer, monitoring tools, permissionless nodes etc.

> 🚨 This package is currently designed as a **development tool** for testing configurations and scenarios within the Polygon CDK stack. **It is not recommended for long-running or production environments such as testnets or mainnet**. If you need help, you can [reach out to the Polygon team](https://polygon.technology/interest-form) or [talk to an Implementation Partner (IP)](https://ecosystem.polygon.technology/spn/cdk/).

To understand how to configure Kurtosis for these use cases, refer to the [documentation](.github/tests/README.md) and review the test files located in the `.github/tests/` directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To begin, you will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (>= [v4.27.0](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4270) for Mac users) and [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/).

- If you notice some services, such as the `zkevm-stateless-executor` or `zkevm-prover`, consistently having the status of `STOPPED`, try increasing the Docker memory allocation.

If you intend to interact with and debug the stack, you may also want to consider a few additional optional tools such as:

- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)
- [yq](https://pypi.org/project/yq/) (v3)
- [cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [polycli](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-cli)

### Deploy

Once that is good and installed on your system, you can run the following command to deploy the complete CDK stack locally. This process typically takes around eight to ten minutes.

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk github.com/0xPolygon/kurtosis-cdk
```

The default deployment includes [cdk-erigon](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/cdk-erigon) as the sequencer, and [cdk-node](https://github.com/0xPolygon/cdk) functioning as the sequence sender and aggregator. You can verify the default versions of these components and the default fork ID by reviewing input_parser.star. You can check the default versions of the deployed components and the default fork ID by looking at [input_parser.star](./input_parser.star).

To make customizations to the CDK environment, clone this repo, make any desired configuration changes, and then run:

```bash
# Delete all stop and clean all currently running enclaves
kurtosis clean --all

# Run this command from the root of the repository to start the network
kurtosis run --enclave cdk .
```

![CDK Erigon Architecture Diagram](./docs/architecture-diagram/cdk-erigon-architecture-diagram.png)

### Interact

Let's do a simple L2 RPC test call.

First, you will need to figure out which port Kurtosis is using for the RPC. You can get a general feel for the entire network layout by running the following command:

```bash
kurtosis enclave inspect cdk
```

That output, while quite useful, might also be a little overwhelming. Let's store the RPC URL in an environment variable.

> You may need to adjust the various commands slightly if you deployed the legacy [zkevm-node](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-node) as the sequencer. You should target the `zkevm-node-rpc-001` service instead of `cdk-erigon-rpc-001`.

```bash
export ETH_RPC_URL="$(kurtosis port print cdk cdk-erigon-rpc-001 rpc)"
```

That is the same environment variable that `cast` uses, so you should now be able to run this command. Note that the steps below will assume you have the [Foundry toolchain](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed.

```bash
cast block-number
```

By default, the CDK is configured in `test` mode, which means there is some pre-funded value in the admin account with address `0xE34aaF64b29273B7D567FCFc40544c014EEe9970`.

```bash
cast balance --ether 0xE34aaF64b29273B7D567FCFc40544c014EEe9970
```

Okay, let’s send some transactions...

```bash
private_key="0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625"
cast send --legacy --private-key "$private_key" --value 0.01ether 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Okay, let’s send even more transactions... Note that this step will assume you have [polygon-cli](https://github.com/maticnetwork/polygon-cli) installed.

```bash
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$private_key" --verbosity 700 --requests 50000 --rate-limit 50 --concurrency 5 --mode t
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$private_key" --verbosity 700 --requests 500 --rate-limit 10 --mode 2
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$private_key" --verbosity 700 --requests 500 --rate-limit 3  --mode uniswapv3
```

Pretty often, you will want to check the output from the service. Here is how you can grab some logs:

```bash
kurtosis service logs cdk agglayer --follow
```

In other cases, if you see an error, you might want to get a shell in the service to be able to poke around.

```bash
kurtosis service shell cdk contracts-001
jq . /opt/zkevm/combined.json
```

One of the most common ways to check the status of the system is to make sure that batches are going through the normal progression of [trusted, virtual, and verified](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/concepts/transaction-finality/):

```bash
cast rpc zkevm_batchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_virtualBatchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_verifiedBatchNumber
```

If the number of verified batches is increasing, then it means the system works properly.

To access the `zkevm-bridge` user interface, open this URL in your web browser.

```bash
open "$(kurtosis port print cdk zkevm-bridge-proxy-001 web-ui)"
```

When everything is done, you might want to clean up with this command which stops the local devnet and deletes it.

```bash
kurtosis clean --all
```

## FAQ

### Q: What are the different ways to deploy this package?

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand</b></summary>

1. Deploy the package without cloning the repository.

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk github.com/0xPolygon/kurtosis-cdk
kurtosis run --enclave cdk github.com/0xPolygon/kurtosis-cdk@main
kurtosis run --enclave cdk github.com/0xPolygon/kurtosis-cdk@v0.2.15
```

2. Deploy the package with the default parameters.

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk .
```

3. Deploy with the default parameters and specify on-the-fly custom arguments.

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk . '{"deployment_stages": {"deploy_l1": false}}'
```

4. Deploy with a configuration file.

Check the [tests](.github/tests/) folder for sample configuration files.

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk --args-file params.yml .
```

5. Do not deploy with a configuration file and specify on-the-fly custom arguments.

🚨 Avoid using this method, as Kurtosis is unable to merge parameters from two different sources (the parameters file and on-the-fly arguments).

The parameters file will not be used, and only the on-the-fly arguments will be considered.

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk --args-file params.yml . '{"args": {"agglayer_image": "ghcr.io/agglayer/agglayer:latest"}}'
# similar to: kurtosis run --enclave cdk . '{"args": {"agglayer_image": "ghcr.io/agglayer/agglayer:latest"}}'
```

</details>

### Q: How do I deploy the package to Kubernetes?

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand</b></summary>

By default your Kurtosis cluster should be `docker`. You can check this using the following command:

```bash
kurtosis cluster get
```

You can also list the available clusters.

```bash
kurtosis cluster ls
```

If you take a look at your Kurtosis configuration, it should be similar to this:

```yaml
config-version: 2
should-send-metrics: true
kurtosis-clusters:
  docker:
    type: "docker"
```

Let's say you've deployed a local [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) cluster. It would work the same for any type of Kubernetes cluster.

Edit the Kurtosis configuration file.

```bash
vi "$(kurtosis config path)"
```

Under `kurtosis-clusters`, you should add another entry for your local Kubernetes cluster.

```yaml
kurtosis-clusters:
  minikube: # give it the name you want
    type: "kubernetes"
    config:
      kubernetes-cluster-name: "local-01" # should be the same as your cluster name
      storage-class: "standard"
      enclave-size-in-megabytes: 10
```

Then point Kurtosis to the local Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
kurtosis cluster set minikube
```

Deploy the package to Kubernetes.

```bash
kurtosis run --enclave cdk .
```

If you want to revert back to Docker, simply use:

```bash
kurtosis cluster set docker
```

</details>

### Q: I'm trying to deploy the package and Kurtosis is complaining, what should I do?

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand</b></summary>

Occasionally, Kurtosis deployments may run indefinitely. Typically, deployments should complete within 10 to 15 minutes. If you experience longer deployment times or if it seems stuck, check the Docker engine's memory limit and set it to 16GB if possible. If this does not resolve the issue, please refer to the troubleshooting steps provided.

> 🚨 If you're deploying the package on a mac, you may face an issue when trying to pull the [zkevm-prover](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-prover) image! Kurtosis will complain by saying `Error response from daemon: no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8 in the manifest list entries: no match for platform in manifest: not found`. Indeed, the image is meant to be used on `linux/amd64` architectures, which is a bit different from m1 macs architectures, `linux/arm64/v8`.
>
> A work-around is to pull the image by specifying the `linux/amd64` architecture before deploying the package.
>
> ```bash
> docker pull --platform linux/amd64 hermeznetwork/zkevm-prover:<tag>
> kurtosis run ...
> ```

1. Make sure the issue is related to Kurtosis itself. If you made any changes to the package, most common issues are misconfigurations of services, file artefacts, ports, etc.

2. Remove the Kurtosis enclaves.

Note: By specifying the `--all` flag, Kurtosis will also remove running enclaves.

```bash
kurtosis clean --all
```

3. Restart the Kurtosis engine.

```bash
kurtosis engine restart
```

4. Restart the Docker daemon.

### Q: How do I debug in Kurtosis?

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand</b></summary>

Kurtosis is just a thin wrapper on top of Docker so you can use all the `docker`commands you want.

On top of that, here are some useful commands.

1. View the state of the enclave (services and endpoints).

```bash
kurtosis enclave inspect cdk
```

2. Follow the logs of a service.

Note: If you want to see all the logs of a service, you can specify the `--all` flag.

```bash
kurtosis service logs cdk cdk-erigon-sequencer-001 --follow
```

3. Execute a command inside a service.

```bash
kurtosis service exec cdk contracts-001 'cat /opt/zkevm/combined.json' | tail -n +2 | jq
```

4. Get a shell inside a service.

```bash
kurtosis service shell cdk cdk-erigon-sequencer-001
```

5. Stop or start a service.

```bash
kurtosis service stop cdk cdk-erigon-sequencer-001
kurtosis service start cdk cdk-erigon-sequencer-001
```

6. Get a specific endpoint.

```bash
kurtosis port print cdk cdk-erigon-node-001 http-rpc
```

7. Inspect a file artifact.

```bash
kurtosis files inspect cdk cdk-erigon-node-config-artifact-sequencer config.yaml
```

8. Download a file artifact.

```bash
kurtosis files download cdk cdk-erigon-node-config-artifact
```
