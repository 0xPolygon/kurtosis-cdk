# Polygon CDK Kurtosis Package

This project provides a modular, reproducible environment for developing, testing, and running [Polygon CDK](https://docs.agglayer.dev/cdk/) devnets using [Kurtosis](https://kurtosis.com/).

Specifically, this package will:

1. Spin up a local L1 blockchain, fully customizable with multi-client support, leveraging the [Ethereum Kurtosis package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package).
2. Deploy [Agglayer contracts](https://github.com/agglayer/agglayer-contracts) on the L1 chain.
3. Start the [Agglayer](https://github.com/agglayer/agglayer) and its [prover](https://github.com/agglayer/provers), enabling trustless cross-chain token transfers and message-passing, as well as more complex operations between L2 chains, secured by zk proofs.
4. Launch a local L2 blockchain, fully customizable with multi-client support, leveraging the [Optimism Kurtosis package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package). It will deploy an Optimism stack enhanced with [AggKit](https://github.com/agglayer/aggkit) for seamless Agglayer connectivity.
5. Deploy the [zkEVM bridge](https://github.com/0xPolygon/zkevm-bridge-service) to facilitate asset bridging between L1 and L2 chains.

Optional features:

- Run transaction and bridge spammers to simulate network load.
- Deploy monitoring solutions such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Panoptichain](https://github.com/0xPolygon/panoptichain) and [Blockscout](https://www.blockscout.com/) to observe the network.
